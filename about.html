                    <h3>Artist</h3>
                    <li>Vusala (b.1990) completed her master’s degree in Decorative and Applied Arts at the Azerbaijan State Academy of Fine Arts in 2014. Since 2017 she has been the creative driving force behind multiple projects involving three-dimensional mural art in various locations of Baku such as in Icherisheher (the old city), the central streets of Baku, Azerbaijan’s regions, and in Istanbul.</li>
                    <li>While earning recognition for her murals, sculptural works and conceptual videos, and stretching further into graphics and product design, painting remains central to Vusala’s creative pursuits. She is also an active contributor to charitable endeavors, working
                        as an educator with teenagers, including those with limited physical abilities or from underprivileged families and shelters. She is currently involved in advancing regional cultural development by establishing a space and platform for creatives in one of Azerbaijan’s regions.</li>
                    <p>« Everything that I’m looking for in life, I find in art. Everything that I get in life, I mirror in my art. »</p>
                    <li>Vusala Agharaziyeva is an artist based in Azerbaijan, where she has exhibited her works. She believes that the key message conveyed through any creative process should originate from the love of what one does, as well as with everything that surrounds you. Agharaziyeva's artistic process is contingent upon how she is feeling and what she is experiencing at the moment of creation. She employs varying media such as ceramics, painting, digital, and street art in her diverse compositions.</li>
